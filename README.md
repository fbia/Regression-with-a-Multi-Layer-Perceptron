# Regression-with-a-Multi-Layer-Perceptron

Machine learning final project. 
A c++ implementation of a multi layer perceptron (MLP).

The neural network can solve classification and regression tasks.

The code implements:
- MLP training with backpropagation
- grid search for model selection
- regularization: early stopping and weight decay

In the report there is also a performance comparison with an implementation provided by KNime.

It has been applied for classification and a "blind" regression task (competition dataset).
